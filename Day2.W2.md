# Closure
- Closure is the most esoteric of JavaScript concepts
- Enables powerful pro-level functions like ‘once’ and ‘memoize’
- Many JavaScript design patterns including the module pattern use closure
- Build iterators, handle partial application and maintain state in an asynchronous world
```javascript
function multiplyBy2 (inputNumber){
const result = inputNumber*2;
return result;
}
const output = multiplyBy2(7);
const newOutput = multiplyBy2(10);

// this fun will get a new memory every run/invocation
```

## Functions with memories
- When our functions get called, we create a live store of data (local memory/variable environment/state) for that function’s execution context.
- When the function finishes executing, its local memory is deleted (except the returned value)
- But what if our functions could hold on to live data between executions?
- This would let our function definitions have an associated cache/persistent memory
- But it all starts with us returning a function from another function
```javascript
function createFunction() {
 function multiplyBy2 (num){
 return num*2;
 }
 return multiplyBy2;
}
const generatedFunc = createFunction();
const result = generatedFunc(3);

// this fun can be returned from other functions in js

//=======================================================================

function outer (){
 let counter = 0;
 function incrementCounter (){
 counter ++;
 }
 incrementCounter();
}
outer();

// calling a function in the same function call as it was defined
// where we define your ouer fun determines what data it has access to when you call it

//=========================================================================================

function outer (){
 let counter = 0;
 function incrementCounter (){ counter ++; }
 return incrementCounter;
}
const myNewFunction = outer();
myNewFunction();
myNewFunction();

// calling a function outside of the function call in which it was defined
```

**`The bond`** : When a function is defined, it gets a bond to the surrounding Local Memory
(“Variable Environment”) in which it has been defined
---
**Backpaack**
- We return incrementCounter’s code (function definition) out of outer into global and give it a new name - myNewFunction
- We maintain the bond to outer’s live local memory - it gets ‘returned out’ attached on the back of incrementCounter’s function definition.
- So outer’s local memory is now stored attached to myNewFunction - even though outer’s execution context is long gone
- When we run myNewFunction in global, it will first look in its own local memory first (as we’d expect), but then in myNewFunction’s ‘backpack’
---
**we can call this backpack**
- (C.O.V.E) => Closed over Variable Environment
- (P.L.S.R.D) => Persistent Lexical Scope Referenced Data
- Backpack
- Closure

```javascript
function outer (){
   let counter = 0;
   function incrementCounter (){
   counter ++;
   }
   return incrementCounter;
}
const myNewFunction = outer();
myNewFunction();
myNewFunction();

const anotherFunction = outer();
anotherFunction();
anotherFunction();
```
**Individual backpacks** : if we run outer again and store the returned incrementCounter fun definition in anotherFunction , this new incrementCounter fun was created in a new execution context and threrfore has a brand new independent backpack

**Clousre gives our fun persistent memories and entrely new toolkit for writing professional code**
- `Helper functions:` Everyday professional helper functions like ‘once’ and ‘memoize’
- `Iterators and generators:` Which use lexical scoping and closure to achieve the most contemporary patterns for handling data in JavaScript
- `Module pattern:` Preserve state for the life of an application without polluting the global namespace
- `Asynchronous JavaScript:` Callbacks and Promises rely on closure to persist state in an asynchronous environment

scope : is the rules in any programming lang for at any given line of code , what data do i have available to me

Q1
```js
function createCounter(start) {
  let counter = start;

  function increment() {
    return ++counter;
  }

  return increment;
}

// Usage:
const counter1 = createCounter(0);
console.log(counter1());
console.log(counter1());

const counter2 = createCounter(10);
console.log(counter2());
console.log(counter2());

```


---

Q2

```js
function calculateAverage(nums) {
  let sum = nums.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
  let count = nums.length;

  function getAverage() {
    return sum / count;
  }

  return getAverage;
}

// Usage:
const averageCalculator = calculateAverage([10, 20, 30, 40, 50]);
console.log(averageCalculator());
```

---

Q3
```js
function powerOf(base) {
  return function (exp) {
    return Math.pow(base, exp);
  };
}

// Usage:
const powerOfTwo = powerOf(2);
console.log(powerOfTwo(3));
console.log(powerOfTwo(5));

const powerOfThree = powerOf(3);
console.log(powerOfThree(4));
console.log(powerOfThree(2));

```

---

Q4
```js
function compose(...functions) {
  return function (arg) {
    return functions.reduceRight((acc, fn) => fn(acc), arg);
  };
}

// Usage:
function addTwo(x) {
  return x + 2;
}

function double(x) {
  return x * 2;
}

function subtractFive(x) {
  return x - 5;
}

const composedFunction = compose(subtractFive, double, addTwo);
console.log(composedFunction(10));

```
